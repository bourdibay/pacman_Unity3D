pacman_Unity3D
==============

My first game made with Unity3D (version 5.3).

This was a school prototype made in order to become familiar with Unity3D (beginning of 3rd year).
I used the library [Orthello2D](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/95827-Orthello-2D-Framework-100-FREE) to manage 2D sprites. Indeed this game is in full 2D.
I also used the asset [Necromancer GUI](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/80174-Necromancer-GUI-Skin) for the menu design.

I strove to implement the real behavior of the ghosts following [this (excellent) dossier](http://home.comcast.net/~jpittman2/pacman/pacmandossier.html)

Thus each ghost behaves differently, there is an highscore table, musics and sounds, bonuses, and we can provide our own maps.

How to play ?
=============

Use the arrows to move.
Use + and - to zoom in or out.
There are currently only two levels (stored in ./Assets/Resources/Levels/). The scores are stored in the register HKEY_CURRENT_USER/SOFTWARE/%username%/pacman3/.
