pacman_Unity3D
==============

My first game made with Unity3D (version 4). It is also the first time I used C#, thus the code is really a mess. I'll refactor it...one day....maybe...
This was a school prototype made in order to become familiar with Unity3D.

I used the library Othello2D to manage 2D sprites. Indeed this game is in full 2D.

I strove to implement the real behavior of the ghosts following [this (excellent) dossier](http://home.comcast.net/~jpittman2/pacman/pacmandossier.html)

Thus each ghost behave differently, there is an highscore table, musics and sounds, bonus, and we can provide our own maps.
